# Project Setup

From the project root directory run:

`sh bin/setup`

## Creating Sysimage

From the project root directory run:

`sh bin/sysimage`

# Project Development

To run interactive repl in development mode run from the project root directory:

`sh bin/dev`

To run interactive repl in development mode using custom sysimage run from the project root directory:

`sh bin/devsys`


# Testing

To run tests type:

`sh bin/test`

To run tests using custom sysimage type:

`sh bin/testsys`
